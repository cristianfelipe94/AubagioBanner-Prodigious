                        IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
                        WARNING: HEPATOTOXICITY AND RISK OF TERATOGENICITY
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="font-bold">
                        Severe liver injury including fatal liver failure has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and in patients taking leflunomide. Concomitant use of AUBAGIO with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs may increase the risk of severe liver injury. Obtain transaminase and bilirubin levels within 	6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for 6 months after starting AUBAGIO. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, discontinue AUBAGIO and start an accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or charcoal. Patients with pre-existing liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated serum transaminases when taking AUBAGIO.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Based on animal data, AUBAGIO may cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. Pregnancy must be excluded before starting AUBAGIO. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. Pregnancy must be avoided during AUBAGIO treatment or prior to the completion of an accelerated elimination procedure after AUBAGIO treatment.

                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">Warnings and Precautions</span>
                        Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) before initiating treatment, should not normally be treated with AUBAGIO. In clinical trials, if ALT elevation was >3 times the ULN on 2 consecutive tests, patients discontinued AUBAGIO and underwent accelerated elimination.  Consider additional monitoring if co-administering AUBAGIO with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs; monitor patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (eg, unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine). 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Before starting therapy, use of reliable contraception must be confirmed, and the patient counseled on risks to the fetus. Patients with delayed onset of menses or other reason to suspect pregnancy should immediately see their physician for pregnancy testing. Patients who become pregnant or wish to become pregnant should discontinue treatment, followed by accelerated elimination until plasma concentrations of 		<0.02 mcg/mL are verified, a level expected to pose minimal risk to the fetus. Women who become pregnant while taking AUBAGIO may enroll in the AUBAGIO pregnancy registry by calling 1-800-745-4447, option 2.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Teriflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma—it takes an average of 8 months, or up to 2 years, to reach plasma concentrations <0.02 mcg/mL. Elimination may be accelerated by administration of cholestyramine or charcoal, but this may cause disease activity to return in patients who were responding to AUBAGIO.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Decreases in white blood cell counts, mainly of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and platelets have been reported with AUBAGIO. Obtain a complete blood cell count within 6 months before starting treatment, with further monitoring based on signs and symptoms of bone marrow suppression. AUBAGIO is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow disease, or severe uncontrolled infections. Tuberculosis (TB) has been observed in clinical studies of AUBAGIO. Before starting treatment, screen patients for latent TB infection with a tuberculin test. Treatment in patients with acute or chronic infections should not be started until the infection(s) is resolved. Administration of live vaccines is not recommended. The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, or infection may be increased with the use of some medications with immunosuppressive potential, including teriflunomide.

                    <p>
                        Peripheral neuropathy, including polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy, has been reported with AUBAGIO. Age >60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk. If peripheral neuropathy is suspected, consider discontinuing treatment and performing accelerated elimination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Interstitial lung disease and rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with leflunomide; a similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide. If a severe skin reaction develops with AUBAGIO, stop treatment and use accelerated elimination.

                        Blood pressure increases and hypertension have occurred with AUBAGIO. Measure blood pressure at treatment initiation and manage any elevations during treatment.

To minimize any possible fetal risk, men not wishing to father a child and their female partners should use reliable contraception. Men wishing to father a child should discontinue therapy and undergo accelerated elimination, with verification of plasma concentrations <0.02 mcg/mL. Nursing mothers should not use AUBAGIO.
